# Snake Game

This Snake Game is based on the challenge in the Scrimba Frontend Career Path.

## My changes

I did the following changes:

- Use the .key value instead of keyCode
- Gave it a 'retro' styling
- Expanded the grid (and the snake)
- Added an Enemy
- Added lives which can be taken by the enemy, if there are no lives left the game ends
- In this version the high score and latest score is stored

## Supporting Scrimba

Since 2017, we have created over 20 free courses on Scrimba, and we're going to
continue launching free courses. But to pay our bills, we have to charge once
in a while. So if you've ever wanted to "give back" to Scrimba, you can do that by buying
	one of our paid courses

- [Become a professional React developer](https://scrimba.com/course/greact)
- [The Responsive Web Design Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gresponsive)
- [The Ultimate JavaScript Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gjavascript)

	It would also mean the world to us if you share the courses.  

Happy Coding!
